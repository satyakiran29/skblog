# II. Patching `lk`- qetting fastboot access and removing dm-verity and orange state warnings  
> ❕ SKIP ONLY IF you unlocked with DEEP TESTING 
{: .prompt-tip }

> ## There are 2 ways: [local](#1-local-install) or [Website](#2-website) 
{: .prompt-info }

> Do not disconnect the phone during the process
{: .prompt-warning}

### 1. Local install 

1. Open the console again in `MTK Client` folder

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/RJtobaI.png)

2. Make sure your phone is powered off, hold down both **Vol+, Vol-** and connect the usb cable. 

3. Run the command `python mtk r lk lk.bin`. There will now be a `lk.bin` file in **MTK Client** folder.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/gL4Qpc2.png)

4. Download [oplus-unlock](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/oplus-unlock/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract it. Navigate to the `oplus_unlock folder`. It should contain a file `main.py`

   ![](https://i.ibb.co/r68tF52/Screenshot-from-2023-08-02-16-29-59.png)

   ![](https://i.ibb.co/R9VhQPn/Screenshot-from-2023-08-02-16-30-22.png)

5. Move `lk.bin` to **oplus_unlock folder**. Open the console in **oplus_unlock** folder

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/RJtobaI.png)

6. Run `python main.py lk.bin -o lk-patched.bin`. A `lk-patched.bin` file will be created. Move it to **MTK Client** folder. [**Check below website section if you get an error**](#if-you-get-this-error--could-not-find-the-lock-sequence-no-suitable-sequence-was-found)

   ![](https://i.ibb.co/9rc1cKF/Untitled.jpg)

7. Run `python mtk w lk lk-patched.bin` to write the patched 'lk' to your phone.

{: .prompt-tip }

### 2. Website 
> Go through steps 1 - 4 from [Local install](#1-local-install) 
{: .prompt-warning }

5. Go to this [website](https://lkpatcher.r0rt1z2.com/). Upload your lk.bin file and the `lk-patched.bin` will be downloaded. Move it to `MTK Client` folder. If the website gives an error check [FAQ #2](/posts/FAQ/#2-i-patched-my-lk-but-the-phone-still-says-fastboot_verify_fail)

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/HOve3Mv.png)

6. Run command `python mtk w lk lk-patched.bin`  

# III. Installing a Custom Recovery and ROM 

## Prerequisites 
- [latest platform-tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) - you will get errors if you use old platform-tools 
- [QcomMtk-Driver](https://www.mediafire.com/file/nninaiiqy1e5csa/New+QcomMtk_Driver_Setup_V2.0.1.1_GsmMafia.Com.exe) - driver 
- ❗️ If you get an error: `fastboot: usage: unknown reboot target recovery` try this adb installer [ADB and Fastboot ++](https://github.com/K3V1991/ADB-and-FastbootPlusPlus/releases/download/v1.0.8/ADB-and-Fastboot++_v1.0.8.exe) 
- only flash once (you should not need to reflash it) - [vbmeta image](https://github.com/bengris32/releases/releases/download/arrow-1.1/vbmeta.img) - vbmeta.img file 
- a custom rom package - check out the [telegram group](https://t.me/Realme8AOSP) for ROMs 
- GAPPS package - recommended [MindTheGApps for Android 13](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=4279422670115734716) 
- 2 example recovery images: 
   - [lineage-os recovery](https://github.com/bengris32/releases/releases/download/3.0/lineage-20.0-20230613-UNOFFICIAL-nashc-recovery.img) - compatible with Pixel Experience and Lineage OS (and others, check the Custom ROM's description) 
   - [leaf-os recovery](https://github.com/HowWof/releases/releases/download/leaf-2.0.1/recovery.img) - use ONLY with Leaf OS 2 
   
## 1. Rebooting to fastboot 
### Your device needs to be turned on 
1. Open a command prompt window in the **platform-tools** folder. 
2. **On your phone**, enable Developer Options and enable USB Debugging. 
3. In the platform-tools folder open a command prompt and run `adb devices`. You will see `Allow USB Debugging for ...` on phone, check `Always allow...` and hit `Allow`. 
4. In the command prompt run `adb reboot boootloader`. Phone will reboot to a screen that says `fastboot_unlock_verify ok`. 

> ❗ Check [FAQ (frequently asked questions)](posts/FAQ) if something does not work or you have questions 
{: .prompt-tip }

## 2. Installing custom recovery and sideloading custom rom 
> ⚠️ If switching between custom roms skip step 2. 
{: .prompt-info }

> ⚠️ If the required recovery has not changed you may skip step 3 as well, and run `adb reboot recovery` directly.
{: .prompt-info }

1. Move the `recovery.img` and `vbmeta.img` files to the **platform-tools** folder. 
2. Run the command `fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta vbmeta.img`. It should show

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/MZZyTBc.png)

3. Run the command `fastboot flash recovery recovery.img`. The phone should show `USB Transmission ok`/

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/t7wYi3R.png)

4. Now, reboot to recovery mode with the command `fastboot reboot recovery`

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/1zwXUmj.png)

5. In recovery, go to `Factory reset > Format data/factory reset > Format data`. **After** factory reset go back and select `Apply update > Apply from ADB`. You should see this when running `adb devices`:

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/MoiIS9k.png)

6. Now run the command `adb sideload custom-rom.zip` (replace *custom-rom.zip* with custom rom package name). For example I flashed LeafOS 2:

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/QZqi1e1.png)

7. **ONLY** do this step on custom roms **WIHTOUT GAPPS / GMS** (check the rom's description to check). Select `Apply update > Apply from ADB` again and run `adb sideload gapps.zip` (replace *gapps.zip* with package name).

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/DUEMXrn.png)

8. Once finished, in the recovery go back to `Reboot system now`. The phone will reboot into your Custom ROM. 

> If you get a "Signature verification error" on your phone, click `Yes` to continue anyways, this goes the same to any other ZIPs you flash.
